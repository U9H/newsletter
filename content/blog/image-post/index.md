**If you're looking to become a better designer, or want to know what makes some apps great, understanding UI & UX in depth is essential.**  

While both fields relate, individual practice and thought are still necessary.

# What is design?

Before we get into how UI & UX differ, it's important to have a grasp on the definition of design.  Most folks say that design “makes things look pretty”.  My definition is a bit more all-encompassing.

Design is everything.  I know that answer is a cop-out, but stay with me.  Design is any structure that conveys meaning or purpose to a user.  Websites have design, furniture has design, software has design, and even [languages have design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban).

In this story, we're concerned *mostly* with **visual design**.  Visual design explores human sight, perception, and psychology.  Product design, web design, graphic design, and interior design are all examples of visual design.  As it so happens, UI & UX are on that list, too.
